# findmuskist

## TL;DR

Identify users who hide their blue checkmark.

## What is this?

The bird has gone, but the resisters have not.

Despite the addition of `Hide your blue checkmark` option, it's still possible to see whether a user is subscribed to ~~Twitter~~ X by simply reading API response.

This extension does that and shows red checkmark for hidden Muskists - users who subscribe to X but hide the blue checkmark.
